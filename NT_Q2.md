  Description

    problem-we(indians) face lots of scam calls and scammers online. despite having  apps
    like truecaller which show there names and blue ticks(as verified users).we are not safe with this scammers

    solution- verificing each users ID's like adhar or voter ID's or passport and all.but this is not possible as 
    employing a person to verify that is pratically not possible .so how about having ai thing which verifies the ids and 
    verifys them as genuine user(this can be helpful) but should be made at low cost to make it reach to most platforms and domains which are suffering with this scammers.
 
 problem statement-
   
   training a pre-trained model like Tesseract OCR or TrOCR to extract the text from given ID cards and verifying it through sending otp 


  real world impact-
     can be used in the apps like truecaller to verify user and many other apps which suffer due to scammers


technical approch-
    
    choose a model and train in on extracting info from image (cannot choose google cloud vision api or aws textract as they might cost high)
    train a bert model to classify each field like phonenumber,id details,name,etc correctly 
    we can use a SMS gateways like Twilio to verify them and mark as genuine users 


feasibility-
   
    I feel its  feasible in all ways and we have to make this economically feasible so that many platforms can use this at low cost 
    this can be made by using open source models.


roadmap-
 
  1st week- doing a deep research on what models to use so that it costs less and accurate 
  2nd week to 7th week-getting those models and training them 
  8th week to 10th week- testing them and checking can there be any more modifications
  11th week to 14th week- making a interface where this model can be used and connecting all of these
  15thweek- launching it and allowing people to use this\
